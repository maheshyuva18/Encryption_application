# Encryption and Decryption

**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**<br>
The more popular and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm likely to be encountered nowadays is the AES. It is found at least six time faster than triple DES.

**The features of AES are as follows âˆ’**

1.Symmetric key symmetric block cipher<br>
2.128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys<br>
3.Stronger and faster than Triple-DES<br>
<br>
<h3>How to Use it</h3>

<h4>Encryptin :- </h4>

**step1**
: Select Text File that you want to encrypt

**step2**
: Click on the Encrypt Button<br>
- This will Encrypt the File and Generate Keys.txt which contain the Key to Decrypt the particular file<br>

<h4>Decryption :- </h4>


**step1**
: Select Encrypted File that you want to decrypt<br>


**step2**
: Enter the key to Decrypt the File<br>

**step3**
: Click on the Decrypt Button <br>
* Then it will generate the Original File
